## Maze

A ball and target game using matter.js and some nifty maze-generation recursive back tracking algorithm.

Nothing is minimized or optimized. Just wanted to quickly put out something that can be played.

Will be working on adding a timer or increasing level complexity.

### Instructions 

Use `W,A,S,D` to move the ball to the target.
